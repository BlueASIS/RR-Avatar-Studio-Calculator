## Rec Room Avatar Studio Calculator

This is a port of [my web based calculator](https://calc.asis.blue/) for RR AS

Special thanks to Snowfall for doing the majority of this port!

Download the script, and install it to blender like any other addon by going to:
Edit > Preferences > Install > Locate the .py > Enable it by clicking the checkbox!

"Advanced mode" enables a few extra features you can enable when installing (checkbox in the addon menu)

It will appear in the sidebar of your 3D view in blender!
